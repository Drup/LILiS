OCamL-system is a tool to manipulate and interpret L-system.

L-system are a kind of formal grammar defined by Lindermayer (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

This project has two parts :
	- mini-calc, a very small library to use arithmetic expression
	- L-sytem, the core engine

The actual implementation depends of BatEnum from Batteries and OCamlMakefile
The graphical interface depends of the ocaml binding of cairo. This may change in the futur.
You can find it here : https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/cairo/


The whole project is highly WIP, sorry for the lack of documentation !
